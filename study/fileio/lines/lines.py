# the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines.
# If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.

# (A docstring should not be considered a comment.)
